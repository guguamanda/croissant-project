    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky pastry that originated in Austria but is
      now a staple of French cuisine. With its golden-brown exterior and soft,
      airy layers inside, it's the perfect companion to coffee or tea, making it
      a beloved choice for breakfast or a delightful snack.
